/*when we look up all the people in our data set that lived more than
90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Let's
take a closer look at that phenomenon.
    compute and output the average age of the people in the acestry
data set per centure. A person is assighned to a century by taking
their year of death. dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as
in Math.cell(person.died/100).
    For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the
grouping operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a 
function that computes the group for an element in the array and return
an object that maps group names to arrays of group numbers.*/
